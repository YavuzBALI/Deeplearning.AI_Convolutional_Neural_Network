# # Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step
# 
# Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation. 
# 
# By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to: 
# 
# * Explain the convolution operation
# * Apply two different types of pooling operation
# * Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
# * Build a convolutional neural network 
# 
# **Notation**:
# - Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object of the $l^{th}$ layer. 
#     - Example: $a^{[4]}$ is the $4^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[5]}$ and $b^{[5]}$ are the $5^{th}$ layer parameters.
# 
# 
# - Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object from the $i^{th}$ example. 
#     - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example input.
#     
#     
# - Subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.
#     - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the activations in layer $l$, assuming this is a fully connected (FC) layer.
#     
#     
# - $n_H$, $n_W$ and $n_C$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of a given layer. If you want to reference a specific layer $l$, you can also write $n_H^{[l]}$, $n_W^{[l]}$, $n_C^{[l]}$. 
# - $n_{H_{prev}}$, $n_{W_{prev}}$ and $n_{C_{prev}}$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of the previous layer. If referencing a specific layer $l$, this could also be denoted $n_H^{[l-1]}$, $n_W^{[l-1]}$, $n_C^{[l-1]}$. 
# 
# You should be familiar with `numpy` and/or have completed the previous courses of the specialization. Let's get started!

# ## 1 - Packages
# 
# Let's first import all the packages that you will need during this assignment. 
# - [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
# - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a library to plot graphs in Python.
# - np.random.seed(1) is used to keep all the random function calls consistent. This helps to grade your work.

# ## 2 - Outline of the Assignment
# 
# You will be implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network! Each function you will implement will have detailed instructions to walk you through the steps:
# 
# - Convolution functions, including:
#     - Zero Padding
#     - Convolve window 
#     - Convolution forward
#     - Convolution backward (optional)
# - Pooling functions, including:
#     - Pooling forward
#     - Create mask 
#     - Distribute value
#     - Pooling backward (optional)
#     
# This notebook will ask you to implement these functions from scratch in `numpy`. In the next notebook, you will use the TensorFlow equivalents of these functions to build the following model:
# 
# <img src="images/model.png" style="width:800px;height:300px;">
# 
# **Note**: For every forward function, there is a corresponding backward equivalent. Hence, at every step of your forward module you will store some parameters in a cache. These parameters are used to compute gradients during backpropagation. 

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3 - Convolutional Neural Networks
# 
# Although programming frameworks make convolutions easy to use, they remain one of the hardest concepts to understand in Deep Learning. A convolution layer transforms an input volume into an output volume of different size, as shown below. 
# 
# <img src="images/conv_nn.png" style="width:350px;height:200px;">
# 
# In this part, you will build every step of the convolution layer. You will first implement two helper functions: one for zero padding and the other for computing the convolution function itself. 

# <a name='3-1'></a>
# ### 3.1 - Zero-Padding
# 
# Zero-padding adds zeros around the border of an image:
# 
# <img src="images/PAD.png" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 1</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Zero-Padding</b><br> Image (3 channels, RGB) with a padding of 2. </center></caption>
# 
# The main benefits of padding are:
# 
# - It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the "same" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer. 
# 
# - It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels at the edges of an image.
# 
# <a name='ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1 - zero_pad
# Implement the following function, which pads all the images of a batch of examples X with zeros. [Use np.pad](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html). Note if you want to pad the array "a" of shape $(5,5,5,5,5)$ with `pad = 1` for the 2nd dimension, `pad = 3` for the 4th dimension and `pad = 0` for the rest, you would do:
# ```python
# a = np.pad(a, ((0,0), (1,1), (0,0), (3,3), (0,0)), mode='constant', constant_values = (0,0))
# ```

# In[2]:


# GRADED FUNCTION: zero_pad

def zero_pad(X, pad):
    """

# <a name='3-2'></a>
# ### 3.2 - Single Step of Convolution 
# 
# In this part, implement a single step of convolution, in which you apply the filter to a single position of the input. This will be used to build a convolutional unit, which: 
# 
# - Takes an input volume 
# - Applies a filter at every position of the input
# - Outputs another volume (usually of different size)
# 
# <img src="images/Convolution_schematic.gif" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 2</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Convolution operation</b><br> with a filter of 3x3 and a stride of 1 (stride = amount you move the window each time you slide) </center></caption>
# 
# In a computer vision application, each value in the matrix on the left corresponds to a single pixel value. You convolve a 3x3 filter with the image by multiplying its values element-wise with the original matrix, then summing them up and adding a bias. In this first step of the exercise, you will implement a single step of convolution, corresponding to applying a filter to just one of the positions to get a single real-valued output. 
# 
# Later in this notebook, you'll apply this function to multiple positions of the input to implement the full convolutional operation. 
# 
# <a name='ex-2'></a>
# ### Exercise 2 - conv_single_step
# Implement `conv_single_step()`. 
#     
# [Hint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html).

# **Note**: The variable b will be passed in as a numpy array.  If you add a scalar (a float or integer) to a numpy array, the result is a numpy array.  In the special case of a numpy array containing a single value, you can cast it as a float to convert it to a scalar.

    """

# ### 3.3 - Convolutional Neural Networks - Forward Pass
# 
# In the forward pass, you will take many filters and convolve them on the input. Each 'convolution' gives you a 2D matrix output. You will then stack these outputs to get a 3D volume: 
# 
# <center>
# <video width="620" height="440" src="images/conv_kiank.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls>
# </video>
# </center>
# 
# <a name='ex-3'></a>
# ### Exercise 3 -  conv_forward
# Implement the function below to convolve the filters `W` on an input activation `A_prev`.  
# This function takes the following inputs:
# * `A_prev`, the activations output by the previous layer (for a batch of m inputs); 
# * Weights are denoted by `W`.  The filter window size is `f` by `f`.
# * The bias vector is `b`, where each filter has its own (single) bias. 
# 
# You also have access to the hyperparameters dictionary, which contains the stride and the padding. 
# 
# **Hint**: 
# 1. To select a 2x2 slice at the upper left corner of a matrix "a_prev" (shape (5,5,3)), you would do:
# ```python
# a_slice_prev = a_prev[0:2,0:2,:]
# ```
# Notice how this gives a 3D slice that has height 2, width 2, and depth 3.  Depth is the number of channels.  
# This will be useful when you will define `a_slice_prev` below, using the `start/end` indexes you will define.
# 
# 2. To define a_slice you will need to first define its corners `vert_start`, `vert_end`, `horiz_start` and `horiz_end`. This figure may be helpful for you to find out how each of the corners can be defined using h, w, f and s in the code below.
# 
# <img src="images/vert_horiz_kiank.png" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 3</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Definition of a slice using vertical and horizontal start/end (with a 2x2 filter)</b> <br> This figure shows only a single channel.  </center></caption>
# 
# 
# **Reminder**:
#     
# The formulas relating the output shape of the convolution to the input shape are:
#     
# $$n_H = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \Bigr\rfloor +1$$
# $$n_W = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \Bigr\rfloor +1$$
# $$n_C = \text{number of filters used in the convolution}$$
#     
# 
# 
# 
# For this exercise, don't worry about vectorization! Just implement everything with for-loops.

# #### Additional Hints (if you're stuck):
# 
# 
# * Use array slicing (e.g.`varname[0:1,:,3:5]`) for the following variables:  
#   `a_prev_pad` ,`W`, `b`  
#   - Copy the starter code of the function and run it outside of the defined function, in separate cells.  
#   - Check that the subset of each array is the size and dimension that you're expecting.  
# * To decide how to get the `vert_start`, `vert_end`, `horiz_start`, `horiz_end`, remember that these are indices of the previous layer.  
#   - Draw an example of a previous padded layer (8 x 8, for instance), and the current (output layer) (2 x 2, for instance).  
#   - The output layer's indices are denoted by `h` and `w`.  
# * Make sure that `a_slice_prev` has a height, width and depth.
# * Remember that `a_prev_pad` is a subset of `A_prev_pad`.  
#   - Think about which one should be used within the for loops.

# ## 4 - Pooling Layer 
# 
# The pooling (POOL) layer reduces the height and width of the input. It helps reduce computation, as well as helps make feature detectors more invariant to its position in the input. The two types of pooling layers are: 
# 
# - Max-pooling layer: slides an ($f, f$) window over the input and stores the max value of the window in the output.
# 
# - Average-pooling layer: slides an ($f, f$) window over the input and stores the average value of the window in the output.
#

# <td>
# 
# <td>
# <img src="images/a_pool.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
# <td>
# </table>
# 
# These pooling layers have no parameters for backpropagation to train. However, they have hyperparameters such as the window size $f$. This specifies the height and width of the $f \times f$ window you would compute a *max* or *average* over. 
# 
# <a name='4-1'></a>
# ### 4.1 - Forward Pooling
# Now, you are going to implement MAX-POOL and AVG-POOL, in the same function. 
# 
# <a name='ex-4'></a>
# ### Exercise 4 - pool_forward
# 
# Implement the forward pass of the pooling layer. Follow the hints in the comments below.
# 
# **Reminder**:
# As there's no padding, the formulas binding the output shape of the pooling to the input shape is:
# 
# $$n_H = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f}{stride} \Bigr\rfloor +1$$
# 
# $$n_W = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f}{stride} \Bigr\rfloor +1$$

# $$n_C = n_{C_{prev}}$$

# **What you should remember**:
# 
# * A convolution extracts features from an input image by taking the dot product between the input data and a 3D array of weights (the filter). 
# * The 2D output of the convolution is called the feature map
# * A convolution layer is where the filter slides over the image and computes the dot product 
#     * This transforms the input volume into an output volume of different size 
# * Zero padding helps keep more information at the image borders, and is helpful for building deeper networks, because you can build a CONV layer without shrinking the height and width of the volumes
# * Pooling layers gradually reduce the height and width of the input by sliding a 2D window over each specified region, then summarizing the features in that region
